Romane Scherrer is an engineer and researcher specializing in computer vision and signal processing, with a particular focus on deep learning, digital holography, and embedded systems. Her research primarily focuses on developing deep learning models for the detection, segmentation, classification and reconstruction of images of microscopic objects.

She defended her [PhD](projects/1_project/) in Computer Science in September 2023 at the University of New Caledonia, where she developed new computer vision methods tailored to digital holography and embedded systems. The deep models developed by Romane enable the processing of images of microscopic objects in water columns and in flow.

Also a graduate of Arts et MÃ©tiers and holding a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Auckland, Romane gained solid skills in project management and mechanical systems development before starting her PhD. Her generalist engineering training specialized in mechanical engineering allowed her to develop, as part of her thesis, a microscope based on the principle of digital holography requiring mechanical prototyping, electronics, and graphical interface development, in addition to the development of deep learning models and image processing pipelines.

Romane recently completed a post-doctorate at the ISEA Laboratory, where she studied the coupling between attributed graphs and neural networks (GNN) for epidemiological applications as part of the [ANR Spiral project](projects/2_project/). She also worked as a research engineer at the same laboratory, where she adapted models (weight pruning) for deployment on embedded boards with low memory resources. In parallel, she taught as an adjunct lecturer at the Department of Sciences at the University of New Caledonia, where she taught thermodynamics, programming, and image processing. She also supervises multidisciplinary student projects including the mechanical, electronic, and computer development of prototypes.

Romane has several technical and scientific skills: supervised deep learning, data mining, image processing, graphical interface development with PyQt, and embedded Linux systems. She is also proficient in various programming languages, including Python, C++, Matlab, SQL, and LaTeX, as well as specific tools and packages such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Open-CV. In mechanical engineering, she has strong skills in CAD design (Catia, SolidWorks), mechanical stress analysis, CFD fluid mechanics (Ansys), and prototyping with 3D printing and CNC.

Passionate about innovation and new technologies, Romane aims to continue exploring the applications of artificial intelligence and embedded systems, hoping to contribute to advancements in these fields.
